# FizzBuzzFDD

FizzBuzz prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

This was carried out using the Feature driven development process.
his consists of the red, green and refactor stage, which is making the test fail, then making it pass and then refactoring it.
