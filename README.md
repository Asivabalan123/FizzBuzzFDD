# FizzBuzzFDD

FizzBuzz prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

This was carried out using the Test driven development process.
It includes 3 stages:

RED (Write a test that fails)
GREEN (Write a test that passes)
REFACTOR (Change code for better, by ensuring its the most efficient)
